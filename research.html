          <div class="paper-title">Seyeon Kim. “Sorting into Startups: Unpacking Supply‑ and Demand‑Side Dynamics in Hiring.”</div>
          <div class="paper-status">In Preparation for Submission</div>
          Using a proprietary dataset of 7 million job applications and hiring outcomes from a Korean digital hiring platform (2015‑2024), my job‑market paper traces how sorting into startups unfolds across the pipeline. I introduce a framework of applicant search and employer evaluation and show that startups’ lower-credentialed workforce emerges largely from applicants’ targeted search. Startups broaden their funnel by considering candidates across the educational distribution, creating a pipeline inefficiency: startups are more likely to interview middle-status applicants, yet these candidates are the least likely to apply. Together, these contributions clarify when and for whom hiring outcomes reflect mutual selection, and when they result from broader search on one or both sides of the labor market.

          <div class="paper-status">In Preparation for Submission</div>
          I use text network analysis to investigate how employers interpret entrepreneurial experience versus conventional employment. While prior research tends to assume uniformly negative beliefs about former founders, I collect and analyze open-ended employer evaluations of simulated resumes to uncover how such beliefs are structured. Using topic co-occurrence networks and community detection, I find that beliefs about employees tend to cluster cleanly—positive traits like leadership, competence, and stability co-occur, while negative ones remain separate. In contrast, founder resumes evoke more cognitively complex and ambivalent evaluations. Founder resumes activate similar positive traits such as initiative, but these often co-occur with concerns about self-orientation or defiance of authority. These findings suggest that founder experience invites more interpretive ambiguity than prior research has captured, and that the meaning of the same signal may shift depending on the evaluative context.
