          <div class="paper-title">Seyeon Kim. “Sorting into Startups: Unpacking Supply‑ and Demand‑Side Dynamics in Hiring.”</div>
          <div class="paper-status">In Preparation for Submission</div>
          Using a proprietary dataset of 7 million job applications and interview records from a Korean digital hiring platform (2015‑2024), my job‑market paper disentangles how applicant and employer behaviors jointly shape who works for startups. I find that both highly and lower-credentialed candidates gravitate toward startups—but to different types and through distinct mechanisms. I introduce a 2×2 framework of preference- vs. constraint-driven behavior and show that highly credentialed candidates match with prestige-signaling young firms through mutual selection, while lower-credentialed candidates are hired by small startups that still prefer higher-credentialed applicants but cast a wide net out. The study presents novel insights into applicant and employer behavior, sorting mechanisms across the hiring funnel, and heterogeneity among startups.

          <div class="paper-title">Seyeon Kim. “From Founder to Follower: The Return Journey to Paid Employment.”</div>
          <div class="paper-status">In Preparation for Submission</div>
          I use text network analysis to investigate how employers interpret entrepreneurial experience versus conventional employment. I collect and analyze open-ended employer evaluations of simulated resumes to uncover how beliefs are structured. I find that founder resumes activate positive traits such as initiative but also concerns about self-orientation, suggesting interpretive ambiguity in evaluating entrepreneurial experience.
